# Project Name 

Scopes Coffee 
# Project Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to create Scopes Coffee, a unique coffee shop that blends specialty beverages with live music and community connection. The goal is to provide a safe, inclusive, and welcoming space where individuals, especially those who often feel like outcasts, can gather, enjoy quality drinks, and connect through art and music.
# Description
_Scopes Coffee_ will be a locally owned coffee shop that emphasizes transparency, quality, and customer connection. The business will serve premium coffee drinks, teas, and baked goods during the day, creating an environment suitable for productivity and relaxation. In the late hours, the shop will transform into a small venue hosting hardcore and heavy metal shows, with the coffee bar remaining open to serve attendees. The space will be designed not only for students, professionals, and artists, but also for musicians and individuals who are often overlooked by mainstream venues. By prioritizing inclusivity, _Scopes Coffee_ will act as a community hub where all are welcome, but with special focus on creating a safe haven for those who seek belonging.
