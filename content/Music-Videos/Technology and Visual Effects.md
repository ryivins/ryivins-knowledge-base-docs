From practical sets to computer-generated effects, technology has shaped the way music videos are made. Each decade introduces new tools that expand artistic possibilities.  

## Early Practical Effects  

In the 1980s and 90s, directors often relied on practical effects like stop-motion, miniatures, and elaborate stage sets. Videos such as Peter Gabrielâ€™s *Sledgehammer* used Claymation to wow audiences.  

### The Rise of CGI  

By the 2000s, digital tools became essential. Green screen technology, computer-generated imagery, and motion capture allowed videos to create surreal and futuristic worlds.  

### DIY Tools and Accessibility  

Today, editing software and apps let independent artists produce high-quality videos at home. Social media platforms like TikTok thrive on creativity and editing tricks that were once only available in professional studios.
