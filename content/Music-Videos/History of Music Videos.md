Music videos have evolved dramatically over the last century, from early experiments with sound and film to the streaming platforms. They are not just promotional clips, but cultural artifacts that reflect the way music and media intersect.  

## Early Experiments 

	In the 1920's and 30's, short films knows as *soundies* and *scopitones* featured musical preformances. The Beatles later advanced the format with promotional films like *paperback*. 

### The MTV Era

	The launch of MTW in 1981 revolutionized music consumption. The channel popularized the slogan *"I want my MTV"* and made stars a household name. 

### The Internet Age

The rise of You tube in 2005 gave artists direct access to fans worldwide. Viral videos, such as *Gangnam Style*, proved the internet could turn music into a global experience.
