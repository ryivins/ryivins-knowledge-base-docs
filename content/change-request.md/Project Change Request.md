## Project name : Daisy Chain Media 
## Requested By: Rylie Ivins 

## Proposed change:
I am requesting a change in the locations that I am able to travel to for media shoots and videography. As of now, my services are only available in Lubbock, Idalou, Amarillo, and Odessa. 

## Reasons for the Change:
I am running out of places for photography and videography and the current locations I offer do not match the nature and vibe of some of the photos i am wanting to capture. Some examples are trees, rivers, rocks, mountains, ect. 

## How This Change Will Add Value:.
- I can go to clients, they dont have to come to me 
- More Advertisement 
- Making more connections 
- Different scenery=different pictures 
- more creative freedom 
- more income

## How This change Will Affect the Constraints: 
Work will be added on, since I have to travel a further distance. The project timeline will only be extended by travel time. My output and due dates would not change. Additional costs would include travel fees from gas, maintenance, food, and lodging. This change would not require more staff, tools, or experience and I believe that the quality may improve due to more creative freedom.
