  <h1>Description</h1>
<p>
	I'm taking this course to strengthen my skills in web foundations and to help start a portfolio. By the end of the term, I want to be comfortable structuring pages and documenting my work clearly. 
	</p>

<p>
	Long-term, my career goal is to apply development and problem-solving skills to real projects like my concert media and Tour management, as well as my full-time job.
